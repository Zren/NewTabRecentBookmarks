# NewTab Recent Bookmarks

A simple list of the most recent bookmarks, along with the ability to search for a bookmark folder and pin it. Pinned folders display their bookmarks in the most descending chronological order as well.

Favicons are displayed in Chrome. In Firefox, a color is generated based on the website.
